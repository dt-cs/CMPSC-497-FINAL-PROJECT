This can be achieved by defining the base and top diameters and then generating a tapered solid. The relevant RhinoPython functions for this task include creating cones or cylinders with different base and top radii. Specifically, rs.AddCone allows creating a tapered column by specifying base radius and height, but it only tapers to a point.

Generate fabrication-ready panel layout.\n\n### Thinking\nAnalyzing the provided pseudocode and referencing the available RhinoPython functions...\nTo implement the above steps for dividing a planar facade surface into uniform panels optimized for standard sheet sizes, the key operations involve working with the surface boundary, subdividing it into a grid, and generating the resulting panels. Based on the algorithm above, the following RhinoPython functions are needed: rs.AddPlanarSrf to create planar surfaces from boundary curves or subdivided panels, and potentially rs.AddSrfContourCrvs if contour curves are needed for subdivision or trimming. These functions will help define the facade boundary, subdivide it, and generate the fabrication-ready panel layout.\"\n\n### Code\n```python\nimport rhinoscriptsyntax as rs\n\n# Step 1: Get the planar facade surface from the user\nfacade_surface = rs.GetSurface(\"Select the planar facade surface to panelize\")\n\nif facade_surface:\n    # Step 2: Define standard panel size (width and height) - get from user\n    panel_width = rs.GetReal(\"Enter panel width (e.g., 1.2 meters)\", 1.2, 0.01)\n    panel_height = rs.GetReal(\"Enter panel height (e.g., 2.4 meters)\", 2.4, 0.01)\n\n    if panel_width and panel_height:\n        # Step 3: Get surface domain in U and V directions\n        domain_u = rs.SurfaceDomain(facade_surface, 0)  # 0 for U direction\n        domain_v = rs.SurfaceDomain(facade_surface, 1)  # 1 for V direction\n\n        u_start, u_end = domain_u\n        v_start, v_end = domain_v\n\n        # Calculate total length in U and V\n        total_u_length = u_end - u_start\n        total_v_length = v_end - v_start\n\n        # Calculate number of panels in U and V directions\n        num_panels_u = int(total_u_length // panel_width)\n        num_panels_v = int(total_v_length // panel_height)\n\n        # Calculate leftover lengths\n        leftover_u = total_u_length - (num_panels_u * panel_width)\n        leftover_v = total_v_length - (num_panels_v * panel_height)\n\n        # Initialize list to hold panel surfaces\n        panel_surfaces = []\n\n        # Step 4: Loop through grid and create panels\n        for i in range(num_panels_u + 1):\n            for j in range(num_panels_v + 1):\n                # Calculate panel domain in U\n                u0 = u_start + i * panel_width\n                u1 = u0 + panel_width\n                if i == num_panels_u:  # Last column, adjust for leftover\n                    u1 = u_end\n                if u1 > u_end:\n                    u1 = u_end\n\n                # Calculate panel domain in V\n                v0 = v_start + j * panel_height\n                v1 = v0 + panel_height\n                if j == num_panels_v:  # Last row, adjust for leftover\n                    v1 = v_end\n                if v1 > v_end:\n                    v1 = v_end\n\n                # Skip zero or negative size panels\n                if u1 <= u0 or v1 <= v0:\n                    continue\n\n                # Step 5: Extract panel surface by trimming original surface\n                panel = rs.TrimSurface(facade_surface, [(u0, u1), (v0, v1)], delete_input=False)\n\n                if panel:\n                    panel_surfaces.append(panel)\n\n        # Optional: Select all created panels\n        if panel_surfaces:\n            rs.SelectObjects(panel_surfaces)\n            rs.MessageBox(f\"Created {len(panel_surfaces)} panels.\", 0, \"Panelization Complete\")\n        else:\n            rs.MessageBox(\"No panels were created.\", 0, \"Panelization Result\")\n    else:\n        rs.MessageBox(\"Invalid panel size input.\", 0, \"Error\")\nelse:\n    rs.MessageBox(\"No surface selected.\", 0, \"Error\")\n```"}]}

The key steps include modeling the lattice volume, simulating loads and light exposure, and adjusting beam thickness accordingly. While the provided RhinoPython functions do not directly cover simulation or structural analysis, they do include functions for creating and manipulating geometry and lights, which are essential for modeling and visualizing the lattice and light zones. Specifically, to model the lattice beams and nodes, functions for creating curves or surfaces would be needed (though not listed here), but for the lighting simulation aspect, functions to add different types of lights (point, spot, linear, rectangular) are relevant to define light zones. Adjusting beam thickness would involve modifying geometry parameters, which would be done through general geometry manipulation functions (not listed).
